# Use Cases

- Prepare for traffic peaks - run load tests to help prepare your API or service for upcoming traffic surges
- Run load tests in CI/CD to catch and prevent performance regressions before they cause issues for users
- Profile and debug performance issues such as memory leaks, high tail latency caused by GC pauses or high CPU usage, or misconfigured resource pools
- Run smoke tests continuously against production to catch issues (also known as production scripted testing or synthetic monitoring)
- Designed for modern web APIs, headless CMS and e-commerce systems, IoT backends, real-time services, and microservice architectures
- Test internal microservices and components as well as external endpoints
- Scale out and run your tests from your own AWS account with ease

# Features

- **Multiple protocols**:  Load test HTTP, WebSocket, Socket.io, Kinesis, HLS and more.
- **Scenarios**: Support for complex *scenarios* to test multi-step interactions in your API or web app (great for ecommerce, transactional APIs, game servers etc).
- **Load testing & smoke testing**: reuse the same scenario definitions to run performance tests or functional tests on your API or backend.
- **Performance metrics**: get detailed performance metrics (latency, requests per second, concurrency, throughput).
- **Scriptable**: write custom logic in JS, using any of the thousands of useful `npm` modules.
- **Integrations**: `statsd` support out of the box for real-time reporting (integrate with [Datadog](http://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/dogstatsd/), [Librato](https://www.librato.com/docs/kb/collect/collection_agents/stastd.html), [InfluxDB](https://influxdata.com/blog/getting-started-with-sending-statsd-metrics-to-telegraf-influxdb/) etc).
- **Extensible**: write custom reporters, custom plugins, custom protocol engines etc.
- **Cloud-native**: go from running a test locally to running it in your own AWS account, distributed across geographical regions in minutes with [Artillery Pro](https://artillery.io/pro)
- **and more!** HTML reports, nice CLI, parameterization with CSV files.

# Plant Some Trees!

We have planted [over 1,500 new trees](https://ecologi.com/artilleryio) with the help of Artillery community. That's a small forest! We're aiming to grow that to a *large* forest - we're thinking 100,000 trees would be neat.

If you've enjoyed using Artillery and would like to help us out, add your tree to the [Artillery.io forest](https://ecologi.com/artilleryio). üå≤üå≥üå¥ Feel free to drop us a line to let us know too! üíö
