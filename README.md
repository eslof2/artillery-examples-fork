<em><strong>Artillery</strong> is a modern, powerful, easy-to-use load-testing tool.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
Artillery has a strong focus on developer happiness & ease of use, and a batteries-included philosophy.

Artillery's goal is to help developers build <strong>faster</strong>, more <strong>resilient</strong> and more <strong>scalable</strong> applications.
</p>

## Features

- **Mulitple protocols**:  Load-test HTTP, WebSocket and Socket.io applications
- **Scenarios**: Specify *scenarios* to test multi-step interactions in your API or web app
- **Perfomance metrics**: get detailed performance metrics (latency, requests per second, concurrency, throughput)
- **Scriptable**: write custom logic in JS to do pretty much anything
- **High performance**: generate serious load on modest hardware
- **Integrations**: `statsd` support out of the box for real-time reporting (integrate with [Datadog](http://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/dogstatsd/), [Librato](https://www.librato.com/docs/kb/collect/collection_agents/stastd.html), [InfluxDB](https://influxdata.com/blog/getting-started-with-sending-statsd-metrics-to-telegraf-influxdb/) etc)
- **Extensible**: custom reporting plugins, custom protocol engines etc
- **and more!** HTML reports, nice CLI, parameterization with CSV files

# Use Cases

- Benchmark the performance of your API or microservice as you're building it
- Ensure new code does not introduce performance regressions
- Test your code for memory leaks
- Benchmark dependencies (libraries, frameworks, external services) to get a
  feel for their performance characteristics before you integrate
- Run load-tests before you launch to ensure your application can meet
  projected demand

# Quickstart

## Install

**Artillery** is available via [npm](http://npmjs.org)

`$ npm install -g artillery`

## Run A Quick Test

`$ artillery quick -d 30 -r 5 -n 20 http://127.0.0.1:3000/test`

This will run a test for 30 seconds, with 5 new virtual users created every second, with each user sending 20 a `GET` requests to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/test`.

## Run With A More Complex Scenario

`$ artillery run hello.json`

Where `hello.json` is your tests script that contains something like:

(*NB:* test scripts can be written as YAML too)

```javascript
{
  "config": {
      "target": "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
      "phases": [
        { "duration": 120, "arrivalRate": 10 }
      ],
      "defaults": {
        "headers": {
          "content-type": "application/json",
          "x-my-service-auth": "987401838271002188298567"
        }
      }
  },
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "flow": [
        { "get": {"url": "/test"}},
        { "think": 1 },
        { "post": {"url": "/test", "json": { "name": "hassy" }}}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This will run a test for 2 minutes, with 10 virtual users created every second, each of which will send a `GET` and a `POST` request with a pause of 1 second in between. Each request will include two custom headers (`Content-Type` and `X-My-Service-Auth`).

# Create A HTML Report

Once the test completes, you can create a graphical report from the JSON stats produced by `artillery run` with:
`artillery report <report_xxxxx.json>`

These are self-contained HTML files that can be easily shared via email or Dropbox for example.
