# Artillery Engine Example

This repo contains the code for a simple "hello world" Artillery engine that shows how Artillery's
engine API works,  and can serve as a starting point for a custom engine.

## Usage

- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Set up parent folder as `NODE_PATH` so this engine is loaded by Artillery: `export NODE_PATH=$(pwd)/..`
- Run the example script using this engine: `artillery run example.yaml`
